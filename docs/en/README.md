# Hello, World! :id=howchat
## HowChat

> A magical instant chat software.

## Overview

HowChat is committed to providing users with an excellent chat experience. The difference from QQ, WeChat, and DingDing is that it will not prohibit users from developing this software. All the software's extended functions are left to users to develop, and it is committed to creating exclusive chat software. At the same time, HowChat will not prohibit robot behaviors. You can build a chat robot on HowCHat, and the chat data can be saved to a third-party server to ensure user privacy. If you want to start using it, you only need to download our software and choose the official plug-in package to use it quickly!

See [download](use/download.md) for details.
